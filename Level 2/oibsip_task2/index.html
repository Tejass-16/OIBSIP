		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>MS Dhoni is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team. He was born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), India. He is considered one of the greatest Indian cricketers of all time, known for his cool and calm demeanor and his outstanding leadership skills.</p>
		<h2>Family and early days</h2>
		<p>As the number on his jersey suggests, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on 7th July 1981 in Ranchi Jharkhand. MS Dhoni’s mother, Devaki Devi is a housewife. Narendra Singh Dhoni is his elder brother, he is a politician. While his elder sister Jayanti Gupta is an English teacher. His father, Pan Singh, is a former employee of MECON. He got married to Sakshi Singh Rawat in 2010 and the couple has a daughter named Ziva.</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>Dhoni made his debut for the Indian cricket team in December 2004, and quickly established himself as a top-notch wicket-keeper and an aggressive lower-order batsman. He was appointed captain of the Indian team in 2007, and went on to lead the team to several major victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.</p>
		<p>Dhoni is also known for his success in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he captained the Chennai Super Kings and led the team to several IPL titles.</p>
		<h2>The beginning of MS Dhoni in Indian cricket</h2>
		<p>He featured in his debut game and got run out for a duck. The whole series didn’t yield fruitful results but the selectors showed faith in him and gave him another go for the ODI series against Pakistan. The rivalry between India and Pakistan is the one that the whole world watches with keen eyes.

			There couldn’t be a better stage for MS Dhoni and he pounced on the opportunity and announced his arrival in the game of cricket. In Visakhapatnam, Ganguly promoted him to bat at No.3 for the first time. He scored a magnificent 148 off just 123 balls that included 15 fours and 4 towering sixes. India scored a massive 356 and thumped the neighbors by 58 runs.
			
			After that, another explosion from Dhoni’s bat came against Sri Lanka when he scored 183 runs, his highest ODI score till date. Very rapidly, he built a reputation of being a power hitter. But contrary to that, he later made a mark batting down the order when he finished matches for India. In short, there was no stopping MS Dhoni as he rose to the top of Indian cricket in no time.</p>
		<h2>The MS Dhoni era</h2>
		<p>The Indian team had traveled to the Caribbean to take part in the 2007 ODI World Cup. Led by Rahul Dravid, it was a star-studded unit with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. But opposite to the expectations, India crashed out of the tournament in the first round itself after suffering humiliating defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

			The team including MS Dhoni received huge criticism and rage from the fans. Later that year, the inaugural World Cup of T20 cricket was to be held in South Africa. All the big guns had pulled out of the squad and as a result, MS Dhoni became the captain of the side which had young and fresh talents.</p>

			<h2>Captaincy Era</h2>
		<p>India went on to lift the trophy and that was the official inception of the Dhoni era in Indian cricket, under his leadership. He became the ODI captain, after the victorious triumph. Leadership came naturally to him and once he got that, he flourished to his best. After Anil Kumble retired from international cricket, Dhoni became the skipper of all 3 formats for India.

			During his captaincy, the Men in Blue achieved several remarkable victories that included the Commonwealth Bank tri-series in Australia. Team India went on to become No.1 in ICC Test Rankings in his reign.</p>

			<h2>MS Dhoni the Unstoppable</h2>
		<p>MS Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting and became the No.1 ODI batsman in Rankings and amidst all this. He turned out to be the costliest player in the first-ever auction of the Indian Premier League and then went on to lead Chennai Super Kings to IPL titles on 2 occasions.

			Dhoni was in no mood to stop and bagged the most significant achievement of his career when he led India to its second ODI World Cup triumph in 2011. Also, he played an inning of unbeaten 91 in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium. That inning was one of the finest knocks in the history of the game. He soaked in the pressure and calmly took India past the line.
			
			After 2 years, India won the ICC Champions Trophy in England with MS Dhoni being the captain. India reached the semi-finals of the ODI World Cup 2015 and World T20 2016. He relinquished the captaincy post that and handed over the reign to Virat Kohli across all 3 formats. He had retired from the longest format of the game in 2016 but went on to represent the side in ODIs and T20Is.</p>
			
		<h2>Retirement</h2>
		<p>Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket in August 2020, bringing an end to a legendary career that spanned 16 years. He will be remembered as one of the greatest Indian cricketers of all time, and as a true leader and inspiration to millions of people around the world.</p>
